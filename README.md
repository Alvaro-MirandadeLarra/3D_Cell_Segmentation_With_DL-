# 3D Cell_Segmentation using Deep Learning
The organs in our body serve a variety of important functions. These functions depend on the shape of the organ, which, in turn, depends on how the cells are structured. However, cells are not static, but highly dynamic objects. Unexpected events disturb a cellâ€™s life like the wounds created by epithelial disruptions, such as cuts or lesions. How cells adapt to different mechanical forces, particularly in three dimensions, is unknown. To tackle this, I have modified the current segmentation pipeline from the Mao lab using deep learning and transfer learning. I have analysed how different hyperparameters affect the segmentation using different software (Cellpose and Pytorch 3D U-NET). In the end, by using Cellpose and improving it with transfer learning with our ground truth data, I have improved the quality of the segmentation from before by on average a 50% more Good Cell Count. Also, I have obtained a full segmentation of a wound healing movie. I hope that my work will help to understand how cells change shape to close different wounds, and how some shape changes may help the tissue to heal faster. By studying this in detail, my work will help to obtain new insights to improve wound healing processes, which could also aid related diseases like cancer

The image of the car is provided in both machine learning and deep learning, the distinction is that in traditional machine learning, feature extraction requires manual intervention, whereas deep learning automates this process.
